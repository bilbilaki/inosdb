15349,Conflict,Ended,1956-09-18,60,"Conflict is a 1956 ABC series that directly succeeded Warner Brothers Presents. It is most famous for having hosted the effective pilots of 77 Sunset Strip and Maverick.

Although it assumed the same time slot as its predecessor, the two do not share the same format. Where Warner Brothers Presents had been a wheel series, Conflict was a fully anthological series. However, since Cheyenne and Conflict alternated the Tuesday 7:30pm time slot, the net effect was that of a proper wheel series—even though Cheyenne and Conflict were not under the same umbrella title.

The name change was imposed upon its production company, Warner Bros., by ABC executives who believed that ""conflict"" was the missing element in Casablanca and King's Row from Warner Brothers Presents.

The show does not fit neatly into standard American television seasons. It technically superseded Warner Brothers Presents after Casablanca concluded its run in April 1956. And it seems to have provided at least one week of new material at the beginning of the 1957 season, before Sugarfoot, starring Will Hutchins, took its place.",0.0,0,,,Conflict,,,2.6576,en,Scripted,19,1,,,William T.

1537,The Agency,Ended,2001-09-27,60,"The Agency is a CBS television drama that followed the inner-workings of the CIA. The series was created by Michael Frost Beckner and was executive produced by Michael Frost Beckner, Shaun Cassidy Productions and Radiant Productions in association with Universal Network Television and CBS Productions. It aired from September 27, 2001 until May 17, 2003, lasting two seasons. It featured unprecedented filming from the actual CIA headquarters.

The show was controversial regarding its exploration of current international affairs and its treatment of the ethical conflicts inherent in intelligence work. Beckner's pilot script, written in March 2001, posited a re-invented CIA tasked with a ""War on Terror"" after Osama Bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist organization plots a lethal attack on the west. The pilot was to premiere at CIA Headquarters on September 18, 2001 and set to air on CBS September 21, 2001, however, the actual 9/11 attacks convinced the network to hold the pilot and instead air a later episode. That first episode was aired later as the third episode of the first season.

The September 11, 2001 terrorist events changed the way Americans viewed topical entertainment and ""The Agency"", at the time, was one of the most topical offering on network television. The producers of the series quickly responded to this new American perspective on world affairs, but CBS chose to cancel the show shortly after the second season's final episode.",6.8,11,Drama,"spy, central intelligence agency (cia), national security",The Agency,/aJXFbRv0WYRcT8cDOLMaKfVYwye.jpg,/mhtPIDrgYUiR5TN2TzdoMUdp8bi.jpg,7.5829,en,Scripted,44,2,,Will Patton as Jackson Haisley,,
